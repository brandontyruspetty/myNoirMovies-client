Project Title: MyNoirMovies App

Objective:  Using React, build the client-side for an app called myNoirMovies based on its
existing server-side code (REST API and database).

The 5 W's:
Who: The users of your myFlix app—movie enthusiasts who enjoy reading information about
different movies.
2. What: A single-page, responsive app with routing, rich interactions, several interface views,
and a polished user experience. The client-side developed in this Achievement will support
the existing server-side (from Achievement 2) by facilitating user requests and rendering the
response from the server-side via a number of different interface views.
3. When: myFlix users will be able to use it whenever they want to read and save information
about different movies.
4. Where: The app will be hosted online. The myFlix app itself is responsive and can therefore be
used anywhere and on any device, giving all users the same experience.
5. Why: Movie enthusiasts like to be able to access information about different movies,
whenever they want to. Having the ability to save a list of their favorite movies will ensure
users always have access to the films they want to watch or recommend to their peers
